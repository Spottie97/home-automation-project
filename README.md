# Home Automation Project
## Description
The aim of this project is to develop a server on my Raspberry Pi that can Automate things in my house. I will update the project as I move along. I will be starting with the lights. Since this project will be a server I would like it to be accessible from anywhere in the world. Thus I will need to build an API for this, I will also develop a mobile app to control the API as I find it be more convient.

## Phases of Development
 - Ability to turn lights on/off. The lights I use are the Philips Hue lights as they connect to the WiFi.
 - Ability to open blinds, I build my own electric blinds, I will post a link to them once I get to this point.
 - Ability to communicate with items with in the house using voice commands via ChatGPT
 - Ability to control my speakers volume, skip, play, pause, voice search, connect to my phont to access my spotify playlist
 - Ability to controll my cooking equipment e.g. stove, rice cooker etc.
 - Ability to turn TV on/off.
 - Ability to know my location in the house at all times and then pick the speaker closest to me to respond to my voice command.
 - Ability to Google/Bing something for me
 - Ability to access my calander and modify it.

## Tools and Languages used
